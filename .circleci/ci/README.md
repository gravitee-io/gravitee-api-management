# ci

## How it works

APIM CI run in two steps:

1. A pre-step will run the `generate-config` job generate from typescript code the circleCI workflow to execute. (via `npm run generate /tmp/dynamicConfig.yml`)
2. The CircleCI orbs `continuation/continue` execute the generated workflow.

### Conditions to generate the pipeline
The pipeline generation is available according to different conditions:
    - if the branch is supported ( CIRCLE_BRANCH is master or a support branch )
    - if we are working on a branch with changes committed on the base branch


## Install

### Prerequisites:

- Install https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[nvm]
- Use with `nvm use` or install with `nvm install` the version of Node.js declared in `.nvmrc`
- Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```


## Development workflow:

1. Add typescript test with your expected CircleCI config output
2. Write the typescript code which generate CircleCI yaml config
4. Validate locally with `npm run test` and `npm run lint`
5. Run the CI to validate that the generated yaml file work as expected (if not, go to step 1)
6. Done


## Troubleshooting

### Generate CircleCI config locally:

```bash
export APIM_VERSION_PATH=/replace-me/gravitee/gravitee-api-management/pom.xml
export CIRCLE_BRANCH=master
export CI_ACTION=publish_docker_images
export CIRCLE_SHA1=784ff35ca
export CI_DRY_RUN=false
export CI_GRAVITEEIO_VERSION=4.1.0
npm run generate
```

It creates a local file `dynamicConfig.yml` that you can check if it looks like as expected.
