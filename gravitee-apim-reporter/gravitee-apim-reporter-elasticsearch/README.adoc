== Configuration

Please visit our https://documentation.gravitee.io/apim/getting-started/configuration/configure-repositories#api-gateway-configuration[documentation website] for further information.

=== ILM
If you use ElasticSearch in version 7 minimum, you can configure your reporter to use ILM (Index Lifecyle Management) policies.

First, you need to define ILM policies in your ES instance. You may find the documentation https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/set-up-lifecycle-policy.html#ilm-create-policy[here]

Then you can activate the ILM feature by adding these settings in the gravitee.yml file of APIM Gateway:

```yaml
  elasticsearch:
    enabled: true # Is the reporter enabled or not (default to true)
    endpoints:
      - http://${ds.elastic.host}:${ds.elastic.port}
    lifecycle:
      policies:
        health: hot_delete_health # ILM policy for the gravitee-health-* indexes
        monitor: hot_delete_monitor # ILM policy for the gravitee-monitor-* indexes
        request: hot_delete_request # ILM policy for the gravitee-request-* indexes
        log: hot_delete_log # ILM policy for the gravitee-log-* indexes
    index_mode: ilm         # "daily" indexes, suffixed with date. Or "ilm" managed indexes, without date
```

== Testing

By default, unit tests are run with a TestContainer version of ElasticSearch 8.5.2, but sometimes it can be useful to run them against other version of ElasticSearch.
To do so you can use the following commands:

* ES 7.x: `mvn clean test -Delasticsearch.version=7.17.7`
* ES 8.x: `mvn clean test -Delasticsearch.version=8.5.2` (Default)
