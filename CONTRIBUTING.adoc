= Contributing to Gravitee.io

You think Gravitee.io is awesome, and you'd like to contribute?
Here are some guidelines that should help you get started.

== Bootstrap Your Dev Environment

// tag::dev-guide[]
=== Overview

This section explains how to set up your environment to start contributing to APIM.

=== Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed on your computer:

* Java (JDK >= 17)
* Maven
* Docker
* Node.js 22.12.x
* Yarn 4.1.1 (preferably with NVM)

TIP: The UI projects declare `node: ^22.12` and `packageManager: yarn@4.1.1` in their `package.json` files.

=== Get the project and prepare your workspace

Clone the project in your workspace::
[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-api-management
----

Build APIM Management API and Gateway::

The default build command is:
[source, bash]
----
mvn clean install -T 2C
----

If you want to skip license validation, prettier checks, and tests, you can use:
[source, bash]
----
mvn clean install -T 2C -DskipTests=true -Dskip.validation=true
----

NOTE: This command will build create a `distribution` folder in the `target` folder of each module.
These folders contain a full distribution of Management API and Gateway, with default plugins.
These `distribution` folder should be used as the `gravitee.home` environment variable

To get a bundle with all the plugins (default, enterprise etc) you need to build the project with the following profile activated: `bundle-default,bundle-dev`.
For instance:
[source, bash]
----
mvn clean install -T 2C -P bundle-default,bundle-dev
----

Prepare APIM Console UI and Portal UI::

First, be sure to have the correct version of node installed, there are .nvmrc files in the UI projects.
If you've `nvm` installed, you can use `nvm use` to switch to the appropriate version of node.

NOTE: Console and Portal Next are part of an Nx workspace at the root. Portal remains independent.

Then run `yarn`:
 - At the **repository root** for Console and Portal Next (Nx workspace)
 - In `gravitee-api-management/gravitee-apim-portal-webui` for Portal (independent project)

=== AI Agent Context (Docker Compose Full Stack)

This section is the source of truth for AI tools and should also be readable as a quickstart for humans.

Default behavior for AI tools:

* For any "start/run/deploy" request, use the Docker Compose full-stack flow in `docker/quick-setup/mongodb` without asking which path to use.
* Assume the user wants the whole stack deployment unless they explicitly say otherwise.

Full stack quickstart (MongoDB compose):

0) Setup environment (one-time)
   - Use correct Node.js version: `nvm use` (reads from `.nvmrc`)
   - Enable Corepack: `corepack enable` (recommended, included in Node.js 16.10+)
   - OR install Yarn globally: `npm install -g yarn`
1) (Optional) Build backend artifacts
   - `mvn clean install -T 2C -DskipTests=true -Dskip.validation=true`
2) Build console UI (Nx workspace at root)
   - `yarn install`
   - `yarn console:build:prod`
3) Build portal UI (independent project)
   - `cd gravitee-apim-portal-webui && yarn install && yarn build && cd ..`
4) Build local UI Docker images (from repo root)
   - `docker build -t graviteeio/apim-management-ui:latest -f gravitee-apim-console-webui/docker/Dockerfile gravitee-apim-console-webui`
   - `docker build -t graviteeio/apim-portal-ui:latest -f gravitee-apim-portal-webui/docker/Dockerfile gravitee-apim-portal-webui`
5) Start full stack with MongoDB compose
   - `cd docker/quick-setup/mongodb`
   - `LICENSE_KEY=... docker compose up -d`

Runtime endpoints (default compose):

* Gateway: http://localhost:8082
* Management API: http://localhost:8083
* Management UI: http://localhost:8084
* Portal UI: http://localhost:4100
* Mailhog: http://localhost:8025

Ports used by default (must be free):

* 8082, 8083, 8084, 4100, 8025, 27017, 9200, 9300

Build workaround (host JDK 25/Lombok issues):

If the local Maven build fails with Lombok/compiler errors on JDK 25, build in a JDK 21 Maven container:

[source, bash]
----
docker run --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -e HOME=/home/maven -e MAVEN_CONFIG=/home/maven/.m2 -v "$HOME/.m2":/home/maven/.m2 -v "$PWD":/workspace -w /workspace maven:3.9.9-eclipse-temurin-21 mvn -pl gravitee-apim-rest-api/gravitee-apim-rest-api-standalone/gravitee-apim-rest-api-standalone-distribution -am package -DskipTests -Dskip.validation=true
----

To refresh the local Management API image used by `docker/quick-setup/mongodb`:

* `rm -rf gravitee-apim-rest-api/docker/distribution`
* `cp -R gravitee-apim-rest-api/gravitee-apim-rest-api-standalone/gravitee-apim-rest-api-standalone-distribution/target/distribution gravitee-apim-rest-api/docker/distribution`
* `docker build -t graviteeio/apim-management-api:latest gravitee-apim-rest-api/docker`
* `cd docker/quick-setup/mongodb && docker compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate management_api`

Notes:

* If `LICENSE_KEY` is not set, compose will warn and proceed without enterprise features.
* Docker Desktop on Apple Silicon may warn on amd64 images (e.g., Mailhog); it usually still runs.
* Node 25.x is not supported (odd-numbered); use Node 22.12.x.
* **Yarn setup**: The `package.json` declares `packageManager: yarn@4.1.1`. Use Corepack (`corepack enable`) for automatic version management, or install Yarn globally. If neither is available, use the fallback: `npx -y @yarnpkg/cli-dist@4.1.1 <command>`.
* If Docker pull/build fails, ensure Docker Desktop is running and you are logged in if required by the registry.

Environment checks:

* `docker --version` and `docker compose version`
* `node -v` (expect 22.12.x)
* `java -version` (expect 17)
* `mvn -v` (expect 3.9+)
* `git --version`

=== Run Prerequisites

Before starting APIM Management API and Gateway, you need to start MongoDB and ElasticSearch. +
You can, for instance, use docker.

MongoDB::
[source, bash]
----
docker run -p 27017:27017 --name local-mongo -d mongo:7
----

ElasticSearch::
[source, bash]
----
docker run -d --name local-es8 -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.10.4
----
