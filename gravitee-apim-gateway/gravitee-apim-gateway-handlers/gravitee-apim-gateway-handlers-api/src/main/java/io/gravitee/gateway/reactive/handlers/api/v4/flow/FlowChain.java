/**
 * A flow chain basically allows to execute all the policies configured on a list of flows.
 * Each flow can define policies, either on request or response phase. The purpose of the flow chain is to execute the policies in the right order, while multiple flows can be involved.
 * The list of the flows is resolved dynamically thanks to a given {@link FlowResolver} as the flows need to match the current execution context (match the path, http method, condition, ...).
