  title: Gravitee.io APIM - Management API - Analytics
  description: |-
    This API allows to query analytics data from the Gravitee.io APIM.

    The API provides three types of data representations:

    - **Measures**: Return aggregated values for specified metrics
    - **Facets**: Group data by facet values with optional sorting and limits, eventually leading to measures.
    - **Time Series**: Return data points over time with optional grouping by facets, eventually leading to measures.

    Each endpoint allows to query multiple metrics at once within a time range, following the same top-level filters, parameters and dimensions.

          A measures request is a request to obtain a single set of measures / aggregations, without grouping them by bucket.
          
            - Measures requests allow to return aggregated values for the specified metric and aggregations.

            - Available measures can change depending on the required metric.

            - The measures object is always represented as the leaf node of the response for other types of analytics requests.

            - Additional filters can be applied at the metric level, allowing to refine the representation of the metric.

          A facets request is a request to obtain measures grouped by facet.

            - Each metric follows the same top-level facets, limits and order.

            - Each facet can be in turn grouped by facets to provide a multi-dimensional representation of the data.

            - Facets are represented as a tree of facet buckets, following the order given in the by clause of the request.

            - Additional filters can be applied at the metric level, allowing to refine the representation of the metric.
