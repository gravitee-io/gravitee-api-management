    title: Gravitee.io APIM - Management API - Analytics
    description: |-
        This API allows to query analytics data from the Gravitee.io APIM.

        The API provides three types of data representations:

        - **Measures**: Return aggregated values for specified metrics
        - **Facets**: Group data by facet values with optional sorting and limits, eventually leading to measures.
        - **Time Series**: Return data points over time with optional grouping by facet, eventually leading to measures.

        Each endpoint allows to query multiple metrics at once within a time range, following the same top-level filters, parameters and dimensions.

          A time series request is a request to obtain data points over time, organized by a specified interval.
          
            - The time series buckets can be themselves nested by facets (up to 2), allowing to group data by multiple nested facets over time.
          
            - Facets are represented as a tree of facet buckets, following the order given in the by clause of the request.
          
            - Each metric follows the same top-level interval, facets and filters.
          
            - Additional filters can be applied at the metric level, allowing to refine the representation of the metric.
