/**
 * This annotation is used to mark a class as a Domain Service
 *
 * <p>
 *     A Domain Service is a class that will perform business logic that can be both targeted by Use Cases, or other
 *     Domain Services.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *      Most of the time, we can't have different implementation and therefore defining an Interface can be skipped. <br />
 *      However, an interface can be useful in APIM context when existing code (Legacy) already define the logic and we don't want to spend time to extract in regular Domain Service yet.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     An example: revoking an API key can be done in a Use Case (action performed on an API call), or it can be done
 *     when performing another use case (for instance when closing a subscription). We can create a
 *     <code>RevokeApiKeyDomainService</code> that will be called by the <code>RevokeApiKeyUseCase</code>, and <code>CloseSubscriptionUseCase</code>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>NOTE: In Craft literature, we can also see Application Services. We choose to not introduce the term (yet?). <br />
 * Our main focus for now is to split business code from infrastructure code.</p>
