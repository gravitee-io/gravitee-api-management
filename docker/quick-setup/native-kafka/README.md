# APIM with Native Kafka

Here is a docker-compose to run APIM with Native Kafka enabled.

## Run docker-compose

⚠️ You need a license file to be able to run Enterprise Edition of APIM. Do not forget to add your license file into `./.license`.

Docker compose will create the following services :
- `gio_apim_mongodb` : MongoDB database
- `gio_apim_elasticsearch` : Elasticsearch database
- `gio_apim_mailhog` : Mailhog service
- `gio_apim_gateway` : Famous Gravitee Gateway with Kafka enabled
- `gio_apim_management_api` : Gravitee Management Rest-API
- `gio_apim_management_ui` : Gravitee Management Console UI
- `gio_apim_portal_ui` : Gravitee Portal UI
- `gio_apim_kafka` : Kafka broker which must be accessible via Gravitee Gateway
- `gio_apim_kafka-ui` : Simple Kafka UI to see topics and messages. Useful for testing
- `gio_apim_kafka-client` : Kafka client container to run kafka commands. This avoids to configure kafka-client on your local machine.
- `kibana` : Kibana service to view runtime data from Elasticsearch e.g. event metrics, logs.

Docker volumes :
- `./.license` : License file
- `./.ssl` : Contains SSL certificates for this example
- `./.config` : Contains a logback.xml file to enable debug logs for reactor. Optional but can be useful for debugging or understanding some behaviors
- `./.kafka-client-config` : Contains kafka client configuration files. To help to run kafka client commands easily

Up docker-compose :
`APIM_VERSION={APIM_VERSION} docker-compose up -d` 

To be sure to fetch last version of images, you can do
`export APIM_VERSION={APIM_VERSION} && docker-compose down -v && docker-compose pull && docker-compose up`
Or you can do `export APIM_REGISTRY=graviteeio.azurecr.io  && export APIM_VERSION=master-latest && docker-compose up -d` to use the latest version. but you need to have access to the internal registry.



# APIM Quick Setup with Native Kafka

In this example, we will create a Kafka API and consume it with a Kafka client using the gateway.
The Gravitee gateway exposes a Kafka port 9092. It also requires an SSL configuration to use SNI.
In this example, we will use a self-signed wildcard certificate `*.kafka.local`.


## General Configuration

The gateway is already configured with the static part of the `kafka.local` certificate via the environment variable `gravitee_kafka_routingHostMode_defaultDomain`.\
To configure this in the different UI applications, it must be set in the Console UI.
- Go to the console `http://localhost:8084/` (user: admin, password: admin) 
- Then: Organization > Entrypoints & Sharding Tags > Entrypoint Configuration. 
- Set the Default Kafka Domain to `kafka.local`.


## Create a APIM Kafka API
1. Go to the console `http://localhost:8084/` > API > Add API > Create API
2. Enter a name and version, e.g., `foo` and `1.0.0`
3. Select Kafka Protocol
4. Configure entrypoints  
  This allows you to create the host on which the API will be used via the gateway. The host prefix in our case will be contained in the wildcard part of the certificate `*.kafka.local`.\
  Enter `foo` or `bar`. Only these two values work in our example. To add more, you need to specify them in the docker-compose `services.gateway.networks.gateway.aliases`.\
  This limitation in our example is due to the simplified local installation and reliance on Docker DNS to resolve domain names.

> NOTE: To add other hosts, you need to add two aliases in our example:
> - `[hostPrefix].kafka.local` The address for the Kafka bootstrap server for the client
> - `broker-0-[hostPrefix].kafka.local` The address of the broker with node id 0 that the client will use. In our case, we have only one broker, so 0.  
> In a real use case with a wildcard certificate, this part is invisible. However, if you do not want to use a wildcard certificate, you need to create certificates for each Kafka broker.\
> (The prefix and delimiter are configurable if necessary)


5. Configure endpoints \
This configuration allows the connection/security between the gateway and the Kafka broker.

    - Option 1: PLAINTEXT \
      Specify the Kafka broker bootstrap. In our case, it is the service: `kafka:9091`.
      Select PLAINTEXT as the security protocol.

    - Option 2: SSL \
      Specify the Kafka broker bootstrap intended for SSL. In our case, it is the service: `kafka:9094`.    
      Select SSL as the security protocol.
      Configure a Truststore "JKS With Path" with `./ssl/kafka-client.truststore.jks` and the password `password`.

    - Other options \
      The docker-compose contains other configurations to use SASL or even SASL_SSL, but you will need to customize the configuration.\
      We can even implement a "Path Through" concept with SASL and OAUTHBEARER_TOKEN by configuring an EL for the Token, e.g., `{#context.principal.token}`. This retrieves the token from the "client connection to gateway" to pass it to the broker.

6. Security \
In our example, we keep the Keyless plan. It will always be possible to change the plan later.

7. Review your API configuration \
Validate with Save & Deploy API.

## Produce & Consume with Kafka client
Now that we have created and started an API, we can produce and consume messages with a Kafka client.
Since we have a keyless plan, no subscription is required, and we can use the `kafka-keyless-plan-ssl.properties` configuration, which enables SSL and configures the truststore.

Execute the following commands to produce and consume messages.
```bash
docker exec -it gio_apim_kafka-client bash -c "kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server foo.kafka.local:9092 --producer.config config/kafka-keyless-plan-ssl.properties --topic client-topic-1"`
```
```bash
docker exec -it gio_apim_kafka-client bash -c "kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server foo.kafka.local:9092 --consumer.config config/kafka-keyless-plan-ssl.properties --topic client-topic-1"`
```

### See the API in the portal (next)

Activate the new portal in the environment settings (Settings > Settings > Enable the New Developer Portal)
Publish the `Foo` API with the "Publish the API" button on the main page of the API
Go to the next portal with the URL `http://localhost:8085/next/`
Open "Learn more" > Subscribe > Select Keyless plan > Next

Here you can find information on how to use the Kafka API with the Kafka client.


## Secure My API with an API Key

Optional step, but it may be interesting to secure the API with a Gravitee Plan. In this example, we will use the API Key Plan.
For other plans like JWT and OAuth2, you need to configure the providers, which is beyond the scope of this example.

1. Modify the Foo API > Consumer > Plan > Add new Plan > API Key
2. Nothing specific to Kafka here, it's a standard plan in APIM. Add a Name and finish creating the plan
3. Publish the plan
A dialog will open to confirm the closure of the unsecured Keyless plan and the opening of the secured API Key plan.
> It is not possible to have an unsecured plan and secured plans at the same time.
4. Deploy the API now out of sync

5. Subscribe to my API with the "Default Application"
Create a subscription between the application and the API via the next portal or via the console.\
Example with the console:\
On the API Consumer > Subscriptions > Create Subscription > Search "Default Application" > Select "API Key" > Create\
Copy the API key to use it in the Kafka client.

6. Complete the Kafka client configuration file `kafka-api-key-ssl.properties` with the API key as the password and an MD5 of the API key as the username
```bash
# Example command to generate the MD5
echo -n "a0bf545b-7124-4688-bf54-5b7124b688d2" | md5
```
--> Update the docker-compose to sync the file with the container!

> Or you can go to the portal UI "Next" on the Foo API > My Subscription > Open it > And use the information there

8. Produce and consume messages with the Kafka client 

```bash
docker exec -it gio_apim_kafka-client bash -c "kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server foo.kafka.local:9092 --producer.config config/kafka-api-key-plan-ssl.properties --topic client-topic-1"`
```
```bash
docker exec -it gio_apim_kafka-client bash -c "kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server foo.kafka.local:9092 --consumer.config config/kafka-api-key-plan-ssl.properties --topic client-topic-1"`
```
