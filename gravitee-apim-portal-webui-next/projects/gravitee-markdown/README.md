# @gravitee/gravitee-markdown

A library for Gravitee Markdown, an enriched markdown language. This library provides components for editing and viewing Gravitee Markdown content, along with various components that can be used within the editor.

## Overview

Gravitee Markdown is an enriched markdown language that extends standard markdown with additional features and components. This library provides:

- **Editor Component**: A text editor for creating and editing Gravitee Markdown content
- **Viewer Component**: A component for rendering and displaying Gravitee Markdown content
- **Editor Components**: Various specialized Angular components that can be embedded within the editor and will be rendered in the viewer for enhanced functionality

## Development

### Code Scaffolding

To generate new components, directives, pipes, or other Angular artifacts, use the Angular CLI with the library prefix:

```bash
# Generate a new component
ng generate component component-name --project=gravitee-markdown

# Generate a new directive
ng generate directive directive-name --project=gravitee-markdown

# Generate a new pipe
ng generate pipe pipe-name --project=gravitee-markdown

# Generate a new service
ng generate service service-name --project=gravitee-markdown
```

**Important**: Always specify `--project=gravitee-markdown` to ensure the component is generated in the correct library project.

### Building the Library

To build the library, run:

```bash
# Build the library
ng build gravitee-markdown

# Build with production configuration
ng build gravitee-markdown --configuration=production
```

This command will compile the project, and the build artifacts will be placed in the `dist/gravitee-markdown/` directory.

## Testing

**Note**: Tests are currently executed by the parent project. The library itself does not have its own test runner configured at this time.

For testing the library components, run the tests from the parent project root:

```bash
# From the parent project root
yarn test
```
